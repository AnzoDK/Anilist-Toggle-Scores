# Anilist-Toggle-Scores
Anilist Toggle Scores

## What?
This small script adds a ~really ugly~ button to toggle the visibility of scores on AniLists browse/search page

## Why?
Sometimes a good show can hide behind a really bad score, and sometimes the score influences your decision to take a gamble on a show that sounds interesting - This script aims to minimize that factor, and lets you be a little more daring and exploritive with your anime choices :)

## Compatibility
The script should work with all browsers on desktop, and is tested with TamperMonkey and ViolentMonkey
